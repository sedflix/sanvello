# Sanvello Data Visualisation 

[Sanvello](http://sanvello.com/) is an based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness meditation, strategies shown to provide effective relief for mental health concerns including anxiety and depression. It allows you to export your data, which are about hought journal, activties, health to-do, mood tracking, etc in form of CSV. 

I didn't like the visualisation by the app or the web version of it. So here are my experiments to get better visualisation.
